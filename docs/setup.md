# Installing / upgrading matterbridge

## Binaries

- Latest stable release [v1.26.0](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/releases/latest)

To install or upgrade just download the latest [binary](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/releases/latest). On \*nix platforms you may need to make the binary executable - you can do this by running `chmod a+x` on the binary (example: `chmod a+x matterbridge-1.24.1-linux-64bit`).
